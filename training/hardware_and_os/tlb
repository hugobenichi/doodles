TLB shootdown

    action of one processor causing the TLBs to be flushed on other processors

    TLB translation lookaside buffer
        hardware cache of the virtual memory table of addresses to physical mem
        accelarates memory addresses lookup

    shared memory between processor
    one processor lock a page of shared memory
        -> all processors have to flush their TLBs

    when a processor changes virtual to physical mapping, the other processors
    needs to invalidate their mapping in their TLB cache.
        1) processor #1 performs the change
        2) flags shootdown request
        3) triggers Inter-Processor Interrupt (IPI) to other procs

    TLB rebuilt is cost-effective is amortized over time
        -> frequent TLB makes virtual memory to perform poorly
