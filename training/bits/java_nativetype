byte (8 bits, signed)
short (16 bits, signed two's complement)
int (32 bits, signed)
long (64 bits, signed)

int literal are type int except if finished with L or l;

float (32 bits IEEE single precision
double (64 bits IEEE double precision)

float literals are double except if finished with F or f;

boolean true or false

char (16 bit single unicode character) min value of '\u0000' and max of '\uffff'

how to detect overflow in java / c


int dec = 26;
int hex = 0x1a;
int bin = 0b11010;

in java &, can insert _ in literals to improve readibility


im memory representation inside JVM

    32bit stack cell.
        boolean, byte, short are padded to int
        double and long takes 2 cells

    arrays of primitives are optimized to take less than 1 cell per element (down to 1 byte)
