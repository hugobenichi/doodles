mmap

    map files or device to physical memory
    actual read from resource is lazy:
        first only associate virtual memory
        load in physical memory on page fault when access

    anonymous mapping: (not POSIX)
        map vmem to nothing
        similar to malloc

    file-backed mapping: default mode

    can be shared across a fork

    synchronization with msync for flushing ram content to disk

    can use mmap for IPC (cf shm_open / shm_unlink)
        shm_open to open file descriptor to "/myregion\0"
        set size with ftruncate
        map to vmem with mmap

        can use posix thread synch across process (mutex, cond, sem, lock)

brk / sbrk

    basic memory management system calls
    control dynamically amount of memory allocated to data segment of process
