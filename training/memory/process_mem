process memory layout

    data segment: r/w and ro data + heap

    data
        portion of process vmem containing global and static variables
        bss section: globals and statics vars without explicit values

    heap
        dynamically allocated mem
        shared by all dynamically loaded modules in a process
        managed by malloc/free (using brk/sbrk)

    code segment
        read only 

    stack
        higher parts of memory
        stack pointer keeps track of top of the stack
        stack overflow error if all space consummed

    on x86, stack grows towards 0. 
        more recent items deeper in call chain are closer to the heap
