like a redblack tree with additional rule:

red node can only be left child of parent

therefore need to consider only two shapes

    a           a
     \           \
      b           b
                   \
                    c

use levelinterger at every node for balancing.

level rules

    level of leaf is 1
    level of left child is level of parent - 1
    level of right child is = parent or = parent - 1
    level of right granchild is strictly less than grandparent
    every node with level > 1 has two children


compared to redblack
    more rotation but simpler algorithm
    similar performances
    AA trees are flatter -> slightly faster time
