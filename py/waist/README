#  gauss_waist
#
#  "wais.py" is a simple python 3 script for Gaussian beam waist analysis
#  It takes as input argument a text file of the form:
#    z_1 h_1 v_1
#    z_2 h_2 v-2
#    z_3 h_3 v_3
#    ...
#  where h_i and v_i are the full width 13.5% maximum values 
#  of the Gaussian profil of your laser beam at position z_i, 
#  horizontal and vertical. If the standard deviation of the 
#  Gaussian profil is sigma, then full width 13.5% maximum is 
#  equal to 4 sigma, or twice the waist at that position.
#
#  the script will calculate the beam waist origin z_0 and waist
#  size w_0 at origin by fitting the data to the standard formula
#  w_0 * sqrt( 1 + (z-z_0)**2 lambda**2 / pi**2 w_0**2 )
#
#  It ouputs on stdout the fitting results, plots the data with
#  its fitted curves, and save the plot to a png file.
#  Units: milimeters
#
#  The wavelength is right now hard-coded in the script. Don't
#  forget to customize the script to your wavelength ( and 
#  include the M2 parameter if needed.)
