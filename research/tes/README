TES analysis
=========

This python package is a collection of scripts for analysis of time waveforms produced by photon number resolving transition edge detectors. However, if you have any interest in this package's routines, you can easily adapt them to your application and data.

Package features
=========

* binary input data read, output textual data writes and graph plotting using matplotlib.

* waveform average and waveform stack traces

* waveform linear filtering with numpy.fft

* fft spectrum computation

Package organization
=========

* ./tes/waveform.py
    binary input reader
    waveform average computation 
    stacked trace computation 
    power spectrum computation
    generation of time and frequency domain axis points

* ./tes/plot.py
    waveform plotting
    fft spectrum plotting
    histogram plotting
    trace image plotting

* ./tes/filter.py
    currently very crude linear filtering
    arbitrary filtering (must compute your own filter coefficients)

* ./spectrum.py
    a script which computes the average waveform, stacked trace image and fft
    power spectrum

* ./wfm_filter.py
    apply some filter to the waveform and looks at the average and stacked
    trace image

All the modules are written for python3. Using the plotting functions will require to compile matplotlib from the github head available at https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib
